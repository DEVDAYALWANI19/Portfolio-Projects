## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Netflix dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and insights about its content library.  
It uses **PostgreSQL** for data analysis and **Power BI** for creating an interactive dashboard.  
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle and loaded into PostgreSQL for SQL querying, and then visualized in Power BI.
